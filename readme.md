# ghterm

ghterm is a TUI browser for Github. Browse repos, users, and more in a simplified interface. 

## Why was this made?

As a fan of terminals and a not-so fan of slow internet speeds, browsing Github on a web browser felt quite sluggish to me. I designed ghterm with a substance-over-style philosophy, particularly in the bit with using as few network calls as possible to provide what's needed.

## Todo

* Replace hardcoded keys with config
* Replace hardcoded tview colors with config
